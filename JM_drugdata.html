    <p>Cocaine, also known as coke, is a strong stimulant mostly used as a recreational drug. It is commonly snorted, inhaled, or injected into the veins. Mental effects may include loss of contact with reality, an intense feeling of happiness, or agitation. Physical symptoms may include a fast heart rate, sweating, and large pupils. High doses can result in very high blood pressure or body temperature. Effects begin within seconds to minutes of use and last between five and ninety minutes. Cocaine has a small number of accepted medical uses such as numbing and decreasing bleeding during nasal surgery.</p>

<p>Cocaine is addictive due to its effect on the reward pathway in the brain. After a short period of use, there is a high risk that dependence will occur. Its use also increases the risk of stroke, myocardial infarction, lung problems in those who smoke it, blood infections, and sudden cardiac death. Cocaine sold on the street is commonly mixed with local anesthetics, cornstarch, quinine, or sugar which can result in additional toxicity. Following repeated doses a person may have decreased ability to feel pleasure and be very physically tired.</p>

<p>Cocaine acts by inhibiting the reuptake of serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine. This results in greater concentrations of these three neurotransmitters in the brain. It can easily cross the blood–brain barrier and may lead to the breakdown of the barrier. Cocaine is made from the leaves of the coca plant which are mostly grown in South America. In 2013, 419 kilograms were produced legally. It is estimated that the illegal market for cocaine is 100 to 500 billion USD each year. With further processing crack cocaine can be produced from cocaine.</p>

<p>After cannabis, cocaine is the most frequently used illegal drug globally. Between 14 and 21 million people use the drug each year. Use is highest in North America followed by Europe and South America. Between one and three percent of people in the developed world use cocaine at some point in their life. In 2013 cocaine use directly resulted in 4,300 deaths, up from 2,400 in 1990. The leaves of the coca plant have been used by Peruvians since ancient times. Cocaine was first isolated from the leaves in 1860. Since 1961 the international Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs has required countries to make recreational use of cocaine a crime.</p>
    
	<h3>Effects</h3>
	
	<p>Repeated snorting will severely damage the nasal mucous membrane. In general, abusers may experience hallucination, paranoia, aggressive behaviour, insomnia, loss of appetite, depression as well as high blood pressure, racing heartbeat and pupil dilation. Cardiac arrest, respiratory failure or other seizures may also occur in serious cases.</p>

    <p>Cannabis (/ˈkænəbɪs/) is a genus of flowering plant that includes three species (and seven taxa) or subspecies, sativa, indica, and ruderalis. The plant is indigenous to central Asia and the Indian subcontinent.</p>

	<p>Cannabis has long been used for hemp fibre, for hemp oils, for medicinal purposes, and as a recreational drug. Industrial hemp products are made from cannabis plants selected to produce an abundance of fiber. To satisfy the UN Narcotics Convention, some cannabis strains have been bred to produce minimal levels of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the principal psychoactive constituent. Many plants have been selectively bred to produce a maximum of THC (cannabinoids), which is obtained by curing the flowers. Various compounds, including hashish and hash oil, are extracted from the plant.</p>

	<p>Globally, in 2013, 60,400 kilograms of cannabis were produced legally. In 2013 between 128 and 232 million people are thought to have used cannabis as a recreational drug (2.7% to 4.9% of the global population between the ages of 15 and 65).</p>
    
	<h3>Effects</h3>
	
	<p>Abusers will experience relaxed state, dilated pupils, hunger and more vivid senses of sight, smell, taste and touch after consumption. Increased talkativeness, mild hallucinations, clumsy and slow reactions. Long-term abusers commonly suffer endocrine disorder, conjunctivitis, bronchitis and smoking-related diseases.</p>

    <p>Commercially produced cough medicines contain varying amounts of the powerful narcotic cough suppressant Codeine. Small doses of codeine effectively relieve cough symptoms by interfering with the signals from the brain which trigger reflex coughing. Large doses produce a euphoric high and youths abuse cough medicine for this purpose. Abuse of Codeine can lead to addiction.</p>
	
	<h3>Effects</h3>
	
	<p>Cough Medicine abusers may suffer from drowsiness , respiratory depression , light-headedness , dry mouth , difficulty to urinate , constipation , and loss of appetite . Itchiness of the skin, nausea, vomiting and confusion are common side effects.</p>

    <p>Heroin is an opioid pain killer. It is also used less commonly as a cough suppressant and as an antidiarrhoeal. Heroin is used as a recreational drug for its euphoric effects. Frequent and regular administration is associated with tolerance and physical dependence. In some countries it is also given to long-term users as a form of opioid replacement therapy alongside counseling.</p>

	<p>Administered intravenously by injection, heroin is two to four times more potent than morphine and is faster in its onset of action. Illicit heroin is sometimes available in a matte-white powder freebase form. Because of its lower boiling point, the freebase form of heroin is smokable. It is the 3,6-diacetyl ester of morphine.</p>

	<p>Heroin was first made by C. R. Alder Wright in 1874 by adding two acetyl groups to the molecule morphine, a natural product of the opium poppy. Internationally, heroin is controlled under Schedules I and IV of the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs. It is generally illegal to manufacture, possess, or sell heroin without a license. In 2012 Afghanistan produced 95% of the world's opium.</p>
	
	<h3>Effects</h3>
	
	<p>Slowed and slurred speech , slow movement, constricted pupils, droopy eyelids, impaired night vision, sedation preceding comatose state and  vomiting. Heroin rapidly causes addiction, impairs the immune system, causes dry, itchy skin, constipation, reduced appetite, irregular heartbeat and blood pressure, menstrual irregularity and decreased sex drive. Repeated injection at the same site causes veins to collapse and septic infection of needle wounds is common. Death can occur from overdoses and diseases such as AIDS can be acquired from sharing needles.</p>

    <p>Ketamine, sold under the brand name Ketalar among others, is a medication mainly used for starting and maintaining anesthesia. It induces a trance-like state while providing pain relief, sedation, and memory loss. Other uses include for chronic pain and for sedation in intensive care. Heart function, breathing, and airway reflexes generally remain functional. Effects typically begin within five minutes when given by injection with the main effects lasting up to 25 minutes.</p>

	<p>Common side effects include psychological reactions as the medication wears off. These reactions may include agitation, confusion, or hallucinations. Elevated blood pressure and muscle tremors are relatively common, while low blood pressure and a decrease in breathing is less so. Spasms of the larynx may rarely occur. Ketamine has been classified as an NMDA receptor antagonist; it also acts on opioid receptors and monoamine transporters among others.</p>

	<p>Ketamine was discovered in 1962. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, of the most important medications needed in a basic health system. It is available as a generic medication. The wholesale cost in the developing world is between 0.08 and 0.32 USD per dose. Ketamine is also used as a drug of abuse and as a recreational drug.</p>
	
	<h3>Effects</h3>
	
	<p>Abusers may suffer from delirium, impaired memory, impaired motor function, respiratory / heart problems / dependence after long-term consumption.</p>

    <p>Methamphetamine is a synthetic amphetamine or stimulant, produced in pill, powder, liquid or crystal form. The crystal form resembles ice, hence the slang name for the drug (ice). Ice is almost pure and therefore produces an intense sensation for the user.</p>

	<p>Ice is sold in small portions varying from a fraction of a gram to several grams and is often packaged in small ziplock bags</p>

	<p>Methamphetamine (contracted from N-methylamphetamine) is a strong central nervous system (CNS) stimulant that is mainly used as a recreational drug and less commonly as a treatment for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and obesity. Methamphetamine was discovered in 1893 and exists as two enantiomers: levo-methamphetamine and dextro-methamphetamine. Methamphetamine properly refers to a specific chemical, the racemic free base, which is an equal mixture of levomethamphetamine and dextromethamphetamine in their pure amine forms. It is rarely prescribed due to concerns involving human neurotoxicity and potential for recreational use as an aphrodisiac and euphoriant, among other concerns, as well as the availability of safer substitute drugs with comparable treatment efficacy. Dextromethamphetamine is a much stronger CNS stimulant than levomethamphetamine. Both enantiomers are neurotoxic and addictive.</p>
	
	<h3>Effects</h3>
	
	<p>After Consumption : Increased breathing rate, heartbeat & body temperature, impaired speech, dilated pupils, dry itchy skin, loss of appetite, insomnia, nervousness, false sense of confidence/power. Violent behaviour, hyperactivity, tremors and paranoia can result from large doses. Comedown can involve severe depression.</p>
    
	<p>Long term : Addiction. Chronic abuse produces psychosis similar to schizophrenia, causing picking at skin, self absorption, hallucinations and days or weeks without sleep. Kidney and lung disorders can affect users.</p>

    <p>Salvia divinorum (also known as sage of the diviners, ska maría pastora, seer's sage, yerba de la pastora and just salvia) is a psychoactive plant which can induce visions and other altered and spiritual experiences. Its native habitat is in cloud forest in the isolated Sierra Mazateca of Oaxaca, Mexico, where it grows in shady and moist locations. The plant grows to over a meter high, has hollow square stems, large leaves, and occasional white flowers with violet calyxes. Botanists have not determined whether Salvia divinorum is a cultigen or a hybrid; native plants reproduce vegetatively, rarely producing viable seed.</p>

	<p>Mazatec shamans have a long and continuous tradition of religious use of Salvia divinorum, using it to facilitate visionary states of consciousness during spiritual healing sessions. Most of the plant's local common names allude to the Mazatecs' post-Columbian belief that the plant is an incarnation of the Virgin Mary, with its ritual use also invoking that relationship.</p>

	<p>Its chief active psychoactive constituent is a structurally unique diterpenoid called salvinorin A, a potent κ-opioid and D2 receptor agonist. Salvia divinorum is generally understood to be of low toxicity (high LD50) and low addictive potential since it is a κ-opioid agonist and a great deal of research has indicated that κ-opioid agonist activation of the kappa opioid receptor as shown by salvia may, in fact, serve as a potent addiction treatment therapy.</p>

    <p>Synthetic cannabinoids are designer drugs that are chemically different from the chemicals in cannabis but which are sold with claims that they give the effects of cannabis. When these chemicals are sprayed or otherwise soaked into a base material which is often plant-based, then the plant with chemicals is sometimes misleadingly called synthetic marijuana. These products are sold for recreational drug use.</p>

	<p>There are several psychoactive artificial cannabinoid families (e.g. AM-xxx, HU-xxx, JWH-xxx, CP xx) that are sold under brand names like K2 and spice, both of which are now used as generic terms used for any synthetic cannabinoid product.</p>

	<p>When synthetic cannabinoid blends first went on sale in the early 2000s, it was thought that they achieved an effect through a mixture of natural herbs. Laboratory analysis in 2008 showed that this was not the case, and that they in fact contain synthetic cannabinoids that act on the body in a similar way to cannabinoids naturally found in cannabis, such as THC. A large and complex variety of synthetic cannabinoids, most often cannabicyclohexanol, JWH-018, JWH-073, or HU-210, are used in an attempt to avoid the laws that make cannabis illegal, making synthetic cannabinoid a designer drug. They have been sold under various brand names, online, in head shops, and other stores. Studies have associated synthetic cannabinoid use with psychotic episodes days after use, some of which have resulted in death.</p>
	
	<h3>Effects</h3>
	
	<p>Abusers may experience hallucination, increased agitation, elevated blood pressure and heart rates, and seizures.</p>
